# Wooden Valhalla — User Persona

---

## Persona: "The Serious Player-Collector"

**Name:** Marcus, 42
**Location:** Mid-size U.S. city
**Occupation:** Engineer, attorney, or small business owner — stable income, disposable cash
**Experience Level:** Intermediate to advanced guitarist, 15+ years playing

---

## Who He Is

Marcus has been playing guitar since high school. He owns 3–8 guitars and considers himself a collector, not just a player. He's not buying guitars to flip — he buys them to own, play, and occasionally let go when the right offer or the right next guitar comes along.

He has strong opinions about gear. He knows the difference between a '59 Burst and a '60, understands what "weight relief" means and why it matters, and he's been burned by misrepresented listings on Reverb before.

He's not looking for the cheapest option. He's looking for the *right* guitar from someone who *knows* guitars.

## Goals

- Find a specific Les Paul — right year, right color, right weight, right price
- Trust that the seller knows what they're talking about and won't hide flaws
- See the guitar from every angle before committing
- Occasionally browse just to see what's out there (aspirational collecting)

---

## Pain Points

- Reverb and eBay listings with bad photos, vague descriptions, and sellers who don't know what they're selling
- Misrepresented condition — cracks hidden by bad lighting, refins not disclosed
- No sense of the seller's credibility or taste
- Hard to find curated, high-quality Les Pauls without sifting through junk

---

## What Earns His Trust

- High-quality photos (multiple angles, natural lighting, hardware close-ups, headstock, back of neck)
- Video showing the guitar played — tone, sustain, any quirks
- Honest, detailed descriptions (including flaws)
- A clear sense that the owner actually plays and cares about these guitars
- A visible history — seeing past guitars the owner has owned signals taste and credibility

---

## Secondary Persona: "The Aspirational Fan"

**Name:** Derek, 29
**Occupation:** Teacher, mid-level professional
**Guitar Experience:** Owns 1–2 guitars, dreams about Les Pauls

He's not buying today, but he's watching. He follows guitar content on YouTube and Instagram. He browses listings the way people browse Zillow for houses they can't afford yet. When he's ready to buy his first serious Les Paul, he'll remember the sites that felt legit and trustworthy.

This persona matters for building an audience and future pipeline.

## What This Means for the Website

- **Photography and video are non-negotiable.** Marcus won't inquire on a guitar he can't fully see.
- **Provenance and storytelling matter.** Past collection pages build credibility and signal taste.
- **Tone is knowledgeable but not pretentious.** Write like a player, not a museum curator.
- **Friction on contact must be low.** One click to inquire, no hoops.
- **Mobile must work.** Marcus is browsing on his phone during lunch or at night on the couch.
